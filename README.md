# Simple Banking System

Simulates a simple banking system. You can create new accounts, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money into, from, and between existing accounts, and delete accounts. Credit card numbers generated by this program are Luhn-compliant, and account information is stored in an SQL database so that it may persist even after the program terminates.
